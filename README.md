A specialized LLVM pass designed to reimagine **Tail Recursion Elimination** (TRE) through an out-of-tree implementation.
Guy L. Steele Jr. in 1977 ([DOI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800179.810196)) observed that certain kinds of function calls, specifically tail calls, can be optimized to avoid increasing the call stack depth — a technique now known as Tail Call Optimization (TCO).
TRE is a specific form of TCO that focuses on optimizing tail-recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves as their final action.

## Features

This repository is shipped with:
- The LLVM pass plugin that can be loaded into the `opt` tool (see [Run the pass with `opt`](#run-the-pass-with-opt) section for more details).
- The LLVM pass that can be registered as part of an existing LLVM (both `clang` and `opt`) default pipeline (see [Run the pass against an existing default LLVM pipeline](#run-the-pass-against-an-existing-default-llvm-pipeline) section for more details).
- A standalone tool (`tre`) to run the **TailRecursionElimination** pass without relying on `opt` (see [Run the pass as executable](#run-the-pass-as-executable) section for more details).
- A set of unit and regression tests for the **TailRecursionElimination** pass using `llvm-lit` and `FileCheck` (see [Testing](#testing) section for more details).
- A benchmarking setup using `llvm-test-suite` to measure the performance impact of the **TailRecursionElimination** pass (see [Benchmarking against llvm-test-suite](#benchmarking-against-llvm-test-suite) section for more details).

## Building the pass

The [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md) file includes detailed instructions on how to set up the system to have an LLVM 21 installation, and how to set the `LLVM_DIR` environment variable accordingly.
For instance:
```bash
export LLVM_DIR=/usr/local/opt/llvm@21 # macOS Intel via Homebrew
export LLVM_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@21 # macOS Apple Silicon via Homebrew
export LLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-21 # Ubuntu x86_64 via apt
export LLVM_DIR=~/llvm-project/llvm-build # LLVM 21 built
```

To easily emit _human-readable_ LLVM IR files (`.ll`) from C/C++ source files, you can use `clang`:

```bash
${LLVM_DIR}/bin/clang -fno-discard-value-names -S -emit-llvm <file>.c -o <file>.ll
```

To build the pass, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLLVM_INSTALL_DIR=${LLVM_DIR} .. # -G Ninja
make # ninja
```

> Note that, the `build` folder is hardcoded within `.clangd` file to provide better IDE support. `clangd` uses the `compile_commands.json` file generated by CMake to provide accurate code completion and navigation features. If you decide to use a different build folder, make sure to update the path in `.clangd` accordingly.

## Run the pass with `opt`

By assuming you have built the pass successfully, you can run it using the `opt` tool provided by your LLVM installation.
To run the pass on an LLVM IR file, use the `opt` tool as follows:

```bash
${LLVM_DIR}/bin/opt \
    --load-pass-plugin build/lib/libTailRecursionElimination.{dylib|so} \
    --passes="print<tailrecelim>" \
    -disable-output \
    <file>.ll
```

> Note that, `-disable-output` is used to avoid generating an output file. If you want to generate an output file, replace `-disable-output` with `-S -o <output-file>.ll`. Assuming you have an LLVM assert build, if your pass leverages the LLVM internal logger, you can either enable logging globally with `-debug` or selectively for your pass only. To enable logging for your pass only, after the definition of the `DEBUG_TYPE=<what-you-want>` macro, you can enable logging by passing the `-debug-only="<what-you-want>"` flag to `opt`.

## Run the pass against an existing default LLVM pipeline

> [!NOTE]
> This section assume that your pass is registered as a step of an existing LLVM pipeline. 
> To do so, you need to register your pass within the `getTailRecursionEliminationPluginInfo()` function by using, for instance, `PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback` which registers your pass at the start of a default pipeline.
> Of course, there are a plethora of other registration methods you can use depending on where you want to insert your pass within the pipeline.
> The [TailRecursionElimination.cpp](lib/TailRecursionElimination.cpp) file registers the **TailRecursionElimination** pass by using `PB.registerVectorizerStartEPCallback` as an example.

By assuming you have built the pass successfully, you can leverage an existing LLVM (both `clang` and `opt`) default (`-O{1,2,3,s,z}`) pipeline to run the pass as a plugin during the lowerings/optimizations.

```bash
${LLVM_DIR}/bin/clang \
    -fpass-plugin=build/lib/libTailRecursionElimination.{dylib|so} \
    -fno-discard-value-names \
    -O{1,2,3,s,z} \ # Pick one optimization level
    -S -emit-llvm \
    <file>.c -o <file>.ll
```

Optionally, you can also specify additional flags:

- `-Rpass=<pass-name>`: to report optimizations performed by the pass.
- `-Rpass-missed=<pass-name>`: to report missed optimizations by the pass.
- `-Rpass-analysis=<pass-name>`: to report analyses performed by the pass.

Or with `opt`:

```bash
${LLVM_DIR}/bin/opt \
    --load-pass-plugin build/lib/libTailRecursionElimination.{dylib|so} \
    --passes="default<O{1,2,3,s,z}>" \ # Pick one optimization level
    -Rpass=tailrecelim \
    -disable-output \
    <file>.ll
```

## Run the pass as executable

You can run the analysis pass through a standalone tool called `tre`.
`tre` is an LLVM based executable defined in
[TailRecursionEliminationMain.cpp](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/ouroboros/blob/main/bin/TailRecursionEliminationMain.cpp).
It is a command line wrapper that allows you to run **TailRecursionElimination** without the need for **opt**:

```bash
<build_dir>/bin/tre <file>.ll
```

It is an example of a relatively basic static analysis tool. Its implementation demonstrates how basic pass management in LLVM works (i.e. it handles that for itself instead of relying on **opt**).

## Testing

In order to run the tests, you need to install `llvm-lit` (i.e., `lit`).
If you have LLVM built from sources, `llvm-lit` is located in the `<llvm-build-dir>/bin/` folder.
On the other hand, it is not bundled with LLVM 21 packages, but you can install it with `pip` or `brew` (on macOS).

```bash
{pip | brew} install lit
```

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
lit -v -a ./build/test
```


## Benchmarking against llvm-test-suite

The `benchmarking` directory contains scripts and documentation (its [README.md](benchmarking/README.md) file) for benchmarking the `TailRecursionElimination` LLVM pass using the `llvm-test-suite`.
